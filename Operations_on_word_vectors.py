# Takeaway for this portion:
# 
# - Cosine similarity is a good way to compare the similarity between pairs of word vectors.
#     - Note that L2 (Euclidean) distance also works.
# - For NLP applications, using a pre-trained set of word vectors is often a good way to get started.
# - Even though you have finished the graded portions, we recommend you take a look at the rest of this notebook to learn about debiasing word vectors.

### 3 - Debiasing word vectors

# Examine gender biases that can be reflected in a word embedding, and explore algorithms for reducing the bias.
# Tto learning about the topic of debiasing, will also help understand what word vectors are doing.
# This section involves a bit of linear algebra.
# 

# Compute a vector that represents the word vector corresponds to the other word
g = word_to_vec_map['woman'] - word_to_vec_map['man']
print(g)            # This encodes the concept of "gender"


# Now, consider the cosine similarity of different words with "g". Consider what a positive value of similarity means vs a negative cosine similarity. 
print ('List of names and their similarities with constructed vector:')

# girls and boys name
name_list = ['john', 'marie', 'sophie', 'ronaldo', 'priya', 'rahul', 'danielle', 'reza', 'katy', 'yasmin']

for w in name_list:
    print (w, cosine_similarity(word_to_vec_map[w], g))


# Female first names have a positive cosine similarity with vector "g", while male first names have a negative cosine similarity. The result seems acceptable. 
# 
# But let's try with some other words.
print('Other words and their similarities:')
word_list = ['lipstick', 'guns', 'science', 'arts', 'literature', 'warrior','doctor', 'tree', 'receptionist', 
             'technology',  'fashion', 'teacher', 'engineer', 'pilot', 'computer', 'singer']
for w in word_list:
    print (w, cosine_similarity(word_to_vec_map[w], g))


# DIt is astonishing how these results reflect certain unhealthy gender stereotypes. 
# Below how to reduce the bias of these vectors, using an algorithm due to [Boliukbasi et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520).

print("cosine similarity between " + e + " and g, after neutralizing: ", cosine_similarity(e_debiased, g))

# ### 3.2 - Equalization algorithm for gender-specific words
# 
# The key idea behind equalization is to make sure that a particular pair of words are equi-distant from the 49-dimensional $g_\perp$.
# The equalization step also ensures that the two equalized steps are now the same distance from $e_{receptionist}^{debiased}$, or from any other work that has been neutralized. 
# 
# The derivation of the linear algebra to do this is a bit more complex. (See Bolukbasi et al., 2016 for details.) But the key equations are: 
# 
# $$ \mu = \frac{e_{w1} + e_{w2}}{2}\tag{4}$$ 
# 
# $$ \mu_{B} = \frac {\mu \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{5}$$ 
# 
# $$\mu_{\perp} = \mu - \mu_{B} \tag{6}$$
# 
# $$ e_{w1B} = \frac {e_{w1} \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{7}$$ 
# $$ e_{w2B} = \frac {e_{w2} \cdot \text{bias_axis}}{||\text{bias_axis}||_2^2} *\text{bias_axis}
# \tag{8}$$
# 
# 
# $$e_{w1B}^{corrected} = \sqrt{ |{1 - ||\mu_{\perp} ||^2_2} |} * \frac{e_{\text{w1B}} - \mu_B} {||(e_{w1} - \mu_{\perp}) - \mu_B||} \tag{9}$$
# 
# 
# $$e_{w2B}^{corrected} = \sqrt{ |{1 - ||\mu_{\perp} ||^2_2} |} * \frac{e_{\text{w2B}} - \mu_B} {||(e_{w2} - \mu_{\perp}) - \mu_B||} \tag{10}$$
